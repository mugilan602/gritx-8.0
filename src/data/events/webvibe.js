            description: "Participants will bring their own laptops and work on developing impactful websites inspired by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A short introduction to SDGs will be given for those unfamiliar with them, after which each team can select one goal to base their website on. They will have 2 hours 30 minutes to design and build a functional, interactive website using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, WordPress, or even AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot. After development, teams will present a 2–3 minute demo highlighting their chosen SDG, features, and impact. Projects will be judged on creativity, usability, relevance to SDGs, and clarity of presentation.",
