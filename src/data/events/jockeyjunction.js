    description: "Get ready to step into the shoes of a Radio Jockey and light up the stage with your voice, wit, and spontaneity! This event combines creativity, quick thinking, and performance in three exciting rounds where participants will guess words with quirky clues, flip perspectives on topics, and bring dialogues alive with expression and energy. Each challenge tests not just your voice, but your ability to engage, entertain, and captivate the audience. From the fast-paced fun of ‘Clash of the Mics’ to the dynamic energy of ‘Radio Relay’ and the expressive creativity of ‘Behind the Voice,’ every round pushes you closer to owning the spotlight. This isn’t just about talking — it’s about performing, adapting, and proving you have the RJ spark that makes every word count.",
